Here's a little bit about me.

I retired in 2014 as a SW engineer; but started out in HW with a BSEE from Northeastern University.  Companies I have worked for include Genrad, Digital Equipment Corp. and EMC.   At each I was fortunate to meet and work with smart people who taught me lot and molded me into a better person.

My hobbies and interests include ham radio, 3D printing, building HW/SW projects (to support ham radio and 3D printing) and singing in choral groups.  That keeps me busy enough that I typically have very little time to just sit around.

I feel that you should never stop trying to learn new things and to that end I decided to learn CAD for 3D model design using Fusion 360; git to keep my projects in some sort of trackable order, Python and the MicroPython/CircuitPython dervatives for development "agility" as well as IDEs and the like.  And then there is continued use of C/C++ and extending my proficiency with them.

As of this date, 5/21, the "project du jour" is the breadboarding of a GPS clock and the Python software to make it all work.  Probably followed shortly thereafter by a GPS disciplined frequency source to use around my lab and ham shack.  As projects are started or revived they will be tracked here on git

I have a very long list of PHDs.  This is not bragging since in my case it is an acronym mfor "(P)rojects (H)alf (D)one."  Time to attack the backlog and dream of new things.
