Here's a little bit about me.

I retired in 2014 as a SW engineer; but started out in HW with a BSEE from Northeastern University.  Companies I have worked for include Genrad, Digital Equipment Corp. and EMC.   At each I was fortunate to meet and work with smart people who taught me lot and molded me into a better person.

My hobbies and interests include ham radio, 3D printing, building HW/SW projects (to support ham radio and 3D printing) and singing in choral groups.  That keeps me busy enough that I typically have very little time to just sit around.

I feel that you should never stop trying to learn new things and to that end I decided to learn CAD for 3D model design using Fusion 360; git to keep my projects in some sort of trackable order, Python and the MicroPython/CircuitPython dervatives for development "agility" as well as IDEs and the like.  And given my age, as time permits, learn rust.

I have a very long list of PHDs - ergo "(P)rojects (H)alf (D)one."  Time to attack the backlog and dream of new things.
